🏛️ Navigating the Pyramid's Platforms

🔹 Starting Point:

After defeating the Caretaker, ascend and turn right to begin navigating the platforms.
⚠️ Caution: The platforms may be hard to see, and the walls are angled. Watch out for the ceiling as hitting it might cancel your jump or send you flying into space.
Equip exotics or subclasses that enhance air mobility. Swords with Eager Edge are recommended for midair adjustments.
🔹 First Platform Section:

New Steps Appear: After the Caretaker is defeated, new steps will appear. Continue along the path until you reach a gap.

Cross the Gap: Cross to the other side and proceed along the exterior of the Pyramid.

Platforms are narrow and often appear above you as you turn the corner.
🟠 Orange lines usually mark the platform edges, helping you spot them.
Platforms Orientation:

The first platform is to your right.
Subsequent platforms are above and in the opposite direction.
Tip: Look around the bend to get an idea of the platform locations.
🔹 Arena with Scorn:

At the top of this series of platforms, you'll find an arena filled with Scorn.
Clear the arena and head to the large open entrance at the end.
Glyph Wall: You'll encounter a large wall that may have glyphs. These change each raid and might hint at the end of the Solar System.
🔹 Activating More Platforms:

Avoid the Glyph Wall: Head outdoors to reach another jumping path around to the right.
Activate Switch: Go back to the Scorn arena to activate a switch that makes more platforms (marked by 🟠 orange lines) appear.
These platforms shorten jumps that might seem too long.
Once one squad member completes the path, the platforms will stabilize for the rest of the team (indicated by the "path stabilized" notice).
🔹 Final Jumping Puzzle Section:

Access the Last Puzzle: From the chamber, locate the entrance on the left and shoot the crystal switch.
Hexagonal Barrels: Activating the switch makes hexagonal barrels slide across the gap to form a passage.
Note: These barrels rotate, so send one confident jumper across first.
Stabilize the Path: Keep pressing the switch to keep barrels rolling over the gap. Once the player reaches the other side, the barrels will stabilize, providing a steady path.
🔹 Clearing the Final Section:

Reach the Final Platform: The last platform on the right leads to a flat section with more Scorn.
Clear the Enemies: Eliminate all Scorn to open the final door.
Assemble Your Team: Gather everyone to proceed to the next area.
