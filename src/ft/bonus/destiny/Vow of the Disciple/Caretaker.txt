🛡️ Roles:

👟 2 Runners/Readers (Trigger the DPS phase):

Enter a room, collect symbols, and then shoot the corresponding symbols on the obelisk.
⚔️ 2 Enemy Cleaners:

Defend the obelisk and eliminate all visible enemies.
🌀 2 Stunners:

Buy time by stunning the guardian and preventing the boss from reaching the obelisk.
🚀 Start of the Confrontation:

Begin by shooting the crux near the door. The boss will appear and walk towards the obelisk. If the boss reaches the obelisk, the team will be wiped out.
👟 Runners:

Enter the room once the door opens.
Find and collect up to 3 symbols.
Remember the symbols and exit the room before accumulating 10 stacks of Penetrating Darkness.
Shoot the collected symbols on the obelisk.
Repeat until all 9 symbols on the obelisk are activated.
🌀 Stunners:

One stunner at the front and one at the back of the boss.
The front stunner draws a slam attack and shoots the boss's face when it glows.
The back stunner shoots the boss's back to stun it for 10 seconds.
Repeat until the runners have completed their task.
⚔️ Enemy Cleaners:

Kill all enemies and prevent them from attacking the obelisk.
🔥 DPS Phase:

Once the obelisk is activated, the DPS phase begins.
The boss heads towards the obelisk and a damaged plate will shine.
All 6 players jump on the plate to gain the Resonance Break buff.
After a moment, switch to the next plate when the first one disappears.
Use your abilities to deal maximum damage, especially when the boss's pale yellow health segment is exposed.
🚨 Final Phase:

Reduce the boss's health to 20% to enter the final phase.
Move to the top floor and use the 3 damaged plates to deal damage until the boss is dead.
Switch plates when the current one disappears. Finish off the boss or the team will be wiped out.
